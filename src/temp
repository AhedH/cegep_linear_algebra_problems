    Prove that each operation of Gauss's Method is reversible.
    That is, show that if two systems are related by a row operation
    $S_1\rightarrow S_2$ then there is a row operation to go back
    $S_2\rightarrow S_1$.
    \begin{answer}
      Reverse a row swap $\rho_i\leftrightarrow\rho_j$ by swapping 
      back $\rho_j\leftrightarrow\rho_i$.
      Reverse the $k\rho_i$ step of multiplying  \( k\neq 0  \) 
      on both sides of a row
      by  dividing through~$(1/k)\rho_i$.

      The row combination case is the nontrivial one.
      The operation $k\rho_i+\rho_j$
      results in this $j$-th row.
      \begin{equation*}
        k\cdot a_{i,1}+a_{j,1}+\cdots+k\cdot a_{i,n}+a_{j,n}=k\cdot d_i+d_j
      \end{equation*}
      The $i$-th row unchanged because of the $i\neq j$ restriction.
      Because the $i$-th row is unchanged, the operation $-k\rho_i+\rho_j$ 
      returns the $j$-th row to its original state.

      (Observe that the \( i=j \) conditino on the $k\rho_i+\rho_j$ 
       is needed, or else this could happen
       \begin{equation*}
         \begin{linsys}{2}
           3x  &+  &2y  &=  &7

        A comparison of the units and hundreds columns of this
        addition shows that there must be a carry from the tens column.
        The tens column then tells us that \( A<H \), so there
        can be no carry from the units or hundreds columns.
        The five columns then give the following five equations.
        \begin{align*}

     The Wohascum County Board of Commissioners, which has 20 members, 
     recently had to elect a President.
     There were three candidates ($A$, $B$, and $C$); on each ballot
     the three
     candidates were to be listed in order of preference, with no abstentions.
     It was found that 11 members, a majority, preferred $A$ over $B$
     (thus the other 9 preferred $B$ over $A$).
     Similarly, it was found that 12 members preferred $C$ over $A$.
     Given these results, it was suggested that $B$ should withdraw, to enable
     a runoff election between $A$ and $C$.
     However, $B$ protested, and it was then found that 14 members preferred
     $B$ over $C$!
     The Board has not yet recovered from the resulting confusion.
     Given that every possible order of $A$, $B$, $C$ appeared on at least 
     one ballot, how many members voted for $B$ as their first choice?
     \begin{answer}
       \answerasgiven
       Eight commissioners voted for $B$.
       To see this, we will use the given information to study how many voters
       chose each order of $A$, $B$, $C$.

       The six orders of preference are $ABC$, $ACB$, $BAC$, $BCA$, $CAB$,
       $CBA$; assume they receive $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, $f$ votes 
       respectively.
       We know that
       \begin{equation*}
         \begin{linsys}{3}
           a  &+  &b  &+  &e  &=  &11  \\
           d  &+  &e  &+  &f  &=  &12  \\
           a  &+  &c  &+  &d  &=  &14
         \end{linsys}
       \end{equation*}
       from the number preferring $A$ over $B$, the number preferring
       $C$ over $A$, and the number preferring $B$ over $C$.
       Because 20 votes were cast, we also know that
       \begin{equation*}
         \begin{linsys}{3}
           c  &+  &d  &+  &f  &=  &9  \\
           a  &+  &b  &+  &c  &=  &8  \\
           b  &+  &e  &+  &f  &=  &6
         \end{linsys}
       \end{equation*}
       from the preferences for $B$ over $A$, for $A$ over $C$, and for
       $C$ over $B$.

       The solution is $a=6$, $b=1$, $c=1$, $d=7$, $e=4$, and $f=1$.
       The number of commissioners voting for $B$ as their first choice 
       is therefore $c+d=1+7=8$.

       \par\noindent {\em Comments.}
       The answer to this question would have been the same had we known only
       that {\em at least\/} 14 commissioners preferred $B$ over $C$.

       The seemingly paradoxical nature of the commissioner's preferences
       ($A$ is preferred to $B$, and $B$ is preferred to $C$, and $C$ is 
       preferred to $A$), an example of ``non-transitive dominance'', is not
       uncommon when individual choices are pooled.

  \item 
    In the first network that we analyzed, with the three resistors  
    in series, we just added to get
    that they acted together like a single resistor of $10$~ohms.
    We can do a similar thing for parallel circuits. 
    In the second circuit analyzed,
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics{ch1.36}
    \end{center}
    the electric current through the battery is $25/6$~amperes.
    Thus, the parallel portion is 
    \definend{equivalent}\index{resistance:equivalent}
    to a single resistor of 
    $20/(25/6)=4.8$~ohms. 
    \begin{exparts}
      \partsitem What is the equivalent resistance if we change
         the $12$~ohm resistor to $5$~ohms?
      \partsitem What is the equivalent resistance if the two are each
         $8$~ohms?
      \partsitem Find the formula for the equivalent resistance if
         the two resistors in parallel are $r_1$~ohms and $r_2$~ohms.
    \end{exparts}
    \begin{answer}
      \begin{exparts}
        \partsitem 
          Using the variables from the earlier analysis,
          \begin{displaymath}
            \begin{linsys}{3}
              i_0&- &i_1    &-  &i_2   &=  &0 \\
             -i_0&+ &i_1    &+  &i_2   &=  &0  \\
                 &  &5i_1   &   &      &=  &20  \\
                 &  &       &   &8i_2  &=  &20  \\
                 &  &-5i_1  &+  &8i_2  &=  &0  
            \end{linsys}
          \end{displaymath}
          The current flowing in each branch is then
          is $i_2=20/8=2.5$, $i_1=20/5=4$, and $i_0=13/2=6.5$, all in amperes.
          Thus the parallel portion is acting like a single resistor
          of size $20/(13/2)\approx 3.08$~ohms.
        \partsitem 
          A similar analysis gives that
          is $i_2=i_1=20/8=4$ and $i_0=40/8=5$~ amperes.
          The equivalent resistance is $20/5=4$~ohms.
        \partsitem 
          Another analysis like the prior ones gives 
          is $i_2=20/r_2$, $i_1=20/r_1$, 
          and $i_0=20(r_1+r_2)/(r_1r_2)$, all in amperes.
          So the parallel portion is acting like a single resistor of
          size $20/i_1=r_1r_2/(r_1+r_2)$~ohms.
          (This equation is often stated as:~the equivalent 
          resistance~$r$ satisfies $1/r=(1/r_1)+(1/r_2)$.)

   Show that in this circuit if the current
   flowing through $r_g$ is zero then $r_4=r_2r_3/r_1$.
   (To operate the device, put the unknown
   resistance at $r_4$.
   At $r_g$ is a meter that shows the current.
   We vary the three resistances $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$\Dash typically
   they each have a calibrated knob\Dash until the 
   current in the middle reads $0$.
   Then the equation gives the value of $r_4$.)
   \begin{answer}
     Kirchoff's Current Law, applied to the node where 
     $r_1$, $r_2$, and~$r_g$ come together, and also 
     applied to the node where $r_3$, $r_4$, and~$r_g$ come
     together gives these.
     \begin{equation*}
       \begin{linsys}{3}
         i_1 &- &i_2 &- &i_g &= &0  \\
         i_3 &- &i_4 &+ &i_g &= &0  
       \end{linsys}
     \end{equation*}
     Kirchoff's Voltage law, applied to the loop in the top right, 
     and to the loop in the bottom right, gives these. 
     \begin{equation*}
       \begin{linsys}{3}
         i_3r_3 &- &i_gr_g &- &i_1r_1 &= &0  \\
         i_4r_4 &- &i_2r_2 &+ &i_gr_g &= &0  
       \end{linsys}
     \end{equation*}
     Assuming that $i_g$ is zero gives that $i_1=i_2$, that $i_3=i_4$,
     that $i_1r_1=i_3r_3$, and that $i_2r_2=i_4r_4$.
     Then rearranging the last equality
     \begin{equation*}
       r_4=\frac{i_2r_2}{i_4}\cdot\frac{i_3r_3}{i_1r_1}
     \end{equation*}
     and cancelling the $i$'s gives the desired conclusion.

           an intersection for a long time.

           Similarly Pier's in/out balance means that $i_2=i_3$ and
           North gives $i_3+25=i_1$.

           \begin{equation*}
             \set{\colvec[c]{25+i_3  \\ i_3  \\i_3} \suchthat i_3\in\Re}
           \end{equation*}
           of course, since the problem is stated in number of cars, we
           might restrict $i_3$ to be a natural number.
        \partsitem
           If we picture an initially-empty circle with the given input/output
           behavior, we can superimpose a $z_3$-many cars circling endlessly
           to get a new solution.
        \partsitem
           A suitable restatement might be:~the number of cars entering the 
           circle must equal the number of cars leaving.
           The reasonableness of this one is not as clear.
           Over the five minute time period we could find that
           a half dozen more cars entered than left, 
           although the problem statement's into/out table 
           does satisfy this property.
           In any event, it is of no help in getting a unique solution
           since for that we would need to know the number of cars circling
           endlessly.

          The row operation $\rho_1+\rho_2$ followed by $\rho_2+\rho_3$
          then $\rho_3+\rho_4$ and $\rho_4+\rho_5$ and finally $\rho_5+\rho_6$
          result in this system.

          Since the free variables are $i_4$ and $i_7$ we take them as 
          parameters.
          \begin{equation*}
          \begin{split}
            i_6  &=  i_7-30  \\
            i_5  &=  i_6+20=(i_7-30)+20=i_7-10 \\
            i_3  &=  -i_4+i_5+30=-i_4+(i_7-10)+30=-i_4+i_7+20 \\
            i_2  &=  i_3-25=(-i_4+i_7+20)-25=-i_4+i_7-5 \\
            i_1  &=  i_2+10=(-i_4+i_7-5)+10=-i_4+i_7+5
          \end{split}
          \end{equation*}
          Obviously $i_4$ and $i_7$ have to be positive, and in fact
          the first equation shows that $i_7$ must be at least $30$.
          If we start with $i_7$, then the $i_2$~equation shows that
          $0\leq i_4\leq i_7-5$.
        \partsitem We cannot take $i_7$ to be zero or else $i_6$ will
          be negative (this would mean cars going the wrong way on the
          one-way street Jay).
          We can, however, take $i_7$ to be as small as $30$, and then 
          there are many suitable $i_4$'s.
          For instance, the solution
          \begin{equation*}
            (i_1,i_2,i_3,i_4,i_5,i_6,i_7)
            =
            (35,25,50,0,20,0,30)
          \end{equation*}
          results from choosing $i_4=0$.

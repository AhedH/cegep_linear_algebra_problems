For subspace:

  \item 
    \begin{exparts}
      \partsitem Prove that every point, line, or plane thru the origin in 
         \( \Re^3 \) is a vector space under the inherited operations.
      \partsitem What if it doesn't contain the origin?
    \end{exparts}
    \begin{answer}
     \begin{exparts}
      \partsitem Every such set has the form
        \( \set{r\cdot\vec{v}+s\cdot\vec{w}\suchthat r,s\in\Re} \)
        where either or both of \( \vec{v},\vec{w} \) may be \( \zero \).
        With the inherited operations, closure of addition
        \( (r_1\vec{v}+s_1\vec{w})+(r_2\vec{v}+s_2\vec{w})
           =(r_1+r_2)\vec{v}+(s_1+s_2)\vec{w} \)
        and scalar multiplication
        \( c(r\vec{v}+s\vec{w})=(cr)\vec{v}+(cs)\vec{w} \)
        are easy.
        The other conditions are also routine.
      \partsitem No such set can be a vector space under the inherited
        operations because it does not have a zero element.
     \end{exparts}  
    \end{answer}

For Subspace:
    Is this a vector space under the natural operations: the real-valued
    functions of one real variable that are differentiable?
    \begin{answer}
      Yes.
      A theorem of first semester calculus says that a sum of differentiable
      functions is differentiable and that
      \( (f+g)^\prime=f^\prime+g^\prime \), and that 
      a multiple of a differentiable
      function is differentiable and that \( (r\cdot f)^\prime=r\,f^\prime \). 
    \end{answer}
